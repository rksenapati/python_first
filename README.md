Task 1

Even or Odd Number Checker
This script determines whether a given number is even or odd.

Prompts the user to input an integer.

Uses the modulus operator % to check if the number is divisible by 2.

Prints a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.

Task 2

Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
This script calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

Initializes a counter (number) to 0.

Iterates from 0 to 50 using range(0, 51).

Adds each number in the range to the counter.

Prints the final sum.

Assignment 3
---------------

Task 1
Factorial Calculator Using Recursion
This script calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

Prompts the user to input a number.

Defines a recursive function factorial(n):

If n is less than 2, it returns 1 (base case).

Otherwise, it returns n * factorial(n-1).

Calls the factorial() function with the input and prints the result.

Task 2

Mathematical Functions using the math Module
This script performs several mathematical calculations on a user-provided number using the math module.

Prompts the user to enter a number.

Calculates and displays:

Square root using math.sqrt()

Natural logarithm (base e) using math.log()

Sine value (in radians) using math.sin()
